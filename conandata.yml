# Run detect_system_deps.py to detect dependencies preinstalled in system.
# conanfile.py accepts options in format `system_<req_name>` or `with_<req_name>`.
#
# The `system_<req_name>` option allows choosing between preinstalled dependency
# and a dependency that needs to be installed from ConanCenter.
#
# The `with_<req_name>` option enables/disables the system dependency.
# This doesn't allow installing the dependency from ConanCenter.
# Currently, only "hyperscan" is such an option.
