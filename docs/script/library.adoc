== I/O streams

=== tee

Just an idea.

[source,fire]
----
// Creates a new stream that forwards output to both streams from args
tee : Stream Stream -> Stream

with (tee (open "file.txt" "w") stderr) {
    write "this goes to both stderr and file.txt"
}
----

To implement the `tee` function, we'd need a callback variant of Stream value.
