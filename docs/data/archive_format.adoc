= DAR - Data Archive File Format

Non-compressed archive with index at the end.
All integer fields are in big-endian.
All offsets are relative to start of the file (simple seek will always work).
Offsets are uint32, thus the total size limit is 4 GB.
File contents are simply concatenated (no padding is inserted).
Inspired by MAR (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Software_Update:MAR)

----
    ARCHIVE:
    - HEADER
    - FILE [NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES]
    - INDEX

    HEADER:
    - ID = "dar1" (4 bytes)
    - INDEX_OFFSET (4 bytes - uint32)

    FILE:
    - CONTENT (CONTENT_SIZE bytes)

    INDEX:
    - NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES (4 bytes - uint32)
    - INDEX_ENTRY [NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES]

    INDEX_ENTRY:
    - CONTENT_OFFSET (4 bytes - uint32)
    - CONTENT_SIZE (4 bytes - uint32)
    - NAME_SIZE (2 bytes - uint16)
    - NAME (NAME_SIZE bytes)
